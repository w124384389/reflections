1. How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It might be the thing we added or changed messed up our program.

2. How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

If we want the features we had before, we don't have to write it again.

3. What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

It will be easier for me to read when I go back.
